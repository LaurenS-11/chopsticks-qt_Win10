# Chopsticks Qt - Windows 10 Edition

A Qt-based implementation of the classic Chopsticks finger game built with C++ and Qt5.

## Game Overview

**Chopsticks** is a classic hand game that combines simple math with strategic thinking. This digital version recreates the beloved finger-counting game where two players try to eliminate each other's hands through clever tapping and splitting moves.

### üéÆ How to Play Chopsticks

#### Basic Setup
- **Players**: 2 players (Player 1 vs Player 2)
- **Starting Position**: Each player begins with **1 finger up** on each hand
- **Goal**: Force your opponent to have **both hands "out"** (5+ fingers) to win

#### üìã Game Rules

**1. Taking Turns**
- Players alternate turns
- On your turn, choose one of your hands to "tap" one of your opponent's hands
- The opponent's tapped hand gains fingers equal to your tapping hand

**2. Finger Math**
```
Example: Your hand has 3 fingers, opponent's hand has 2 fingers
After tapping: Opponent's hand = 2 + 3 = 5 fingers (now "out"!)
```

**3. Hand States**
- **Active Hand**: 1-4 fingers (can tap and be tapped)
- **Out Hand**: 5+ fingers (cannot tap or be tapped, shown as fist)
- **Dead Hand**: Permanently eliminated (fist icon)

**4. Special Move: "Bumping" (Splitting)**
- When you have an **even number** of fingers on one hand, you can **split** them
- Example: 4 fingers on right hand ‚Üí Split to 2 fingers on each hand
- This strategic move can revive a dead hand or balance your attack options

#### üèÜ Winning Conditions
- **Victory**: Your opponent has both hands "out" (5+ fingers each)
- **Continue Playing**: As long as each player has at least one active hand

#### üí° Strategy Tips
- **Offensive**: Try to force your opponent's hands to exactly 5 fingers
- **Defensive**: Use splitting to avoid having both hands reach 5 fingers
- **Tactical**: Sometimes it's better to split even when you don't have to
- **Planning**: Think ahead - consider what your opponent might do next

### üéØ Example Game Sequence

```
Initial State:
Player 1: Left(1) Right(1)    Player 2: Left(1) Right(1)

Turn 1 - Player 1: Taps Player 2's left hand with right hand
Player 1: Left(1) Right(1)    Player 2: Left(2) Right(1)

Turn 2 - Player 2: Taps Player 1's left hand with left hand  
Player 1: Left(3) Right(1)    Player 2: Left(2) Right(1)

Turn 3 - Player 1: Taps Player 2's right hand with left hand
Player 1: Left(3) Right(1)    Player 2: Left(2) Right(4)

Turn 4 - Player 2: Splits right hand (4 ‚Üí 2+2)
Player 1: Left(3) Right(1)    Player 2: Left(2) Right(2)

Turn 5 - Player 1: Taps Player 2's left hand with left hand
Player 1: Left(3) Right(1)    Player 2: Left(5-OUT) Right(2)

... Game continues until one player has both hands out!
```

### üé® User Interface
- **Visual Hand Display**: Clear finger count indicators
- **Click to Play**: Simple point-and-click interface
- **Turn Indicators**: Always know whose turn it is
- **Split Button**: Easy access to splitting when available
- **Game Status**: Win/lose notifications and score tracking

## Building the Project

### Quick Build (Command Line)
```bash
# Configure the project
cmake -B build -S . -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build the project
cmake --build build
```

### Using VS Code
1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Use the CMake extension to configure and build
3. The project will automatically configure with the default preset

### Traditional CMake Build
1. Ensure you have CMake and Qt installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
4. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```
5. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

## Automatic DLL Deployment

üéâ **This project features automatic DLL deployment** that copies all required runtime libraries to the build directory after each successful build, ensuring your application runs on any Windows system without requiring Qt or MinGW to be installed.

### Deployed DLLs

#### Qt5 Libraries
- **Qt5Core.dll** - Core Qt functionality
- **Qt5Gui.dll** - GUI components and rendering
- **Qt5Widgets.dll** - Widget toolkit and UI controls

#### MinGW Runtime Libraries
- **libgcc_s_seh-1.dll** - GCC runtime library
- **libstdc++-6.dll** - C++ standard library
- **libwinpthread-1.dll** - POSIX threading library

#### Qt Platform Plugins
- **platforms/qwindows.dll** - Windows platform integration plugin (required for GUI applications)

### How It Works
The automatic DLL deployment is implemented using CMake's `add_custom_command` with the `POST_BUILD` event:

```cmake
# Automatically copy Qt5 and MinGW runtime DLLs to build directory after build
add_custom_command(TARGET chopsticks-qt POST_BUILD
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
    "${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin/Qt5Core.dll"
    $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:chopsticks-qt>
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
    "${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin/Qt5Gui.dll"
    $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:chopsticks-qt>
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
    "${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin/Qt5Widgets.dll"
    $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:chopsticks-qt>
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
    "${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin/libgcc_s_seh-1.dll"
    $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:chopsticks-qt>
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
    "${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin/libstdc++-6.dll"
    $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:chopsticks-qt>
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
    "${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin/libwinpthread-1.dll"
    $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:chopsticks-qt>
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E make_directory
    $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:chopsticks-qt>/platforms
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
    "${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/plugins/platforms/qwindows.dll"
    $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:chopsticks-qt>/platforms/
    COMMENT "Copying Qt5, MinGW runtime DLLs and platform plugins to build directory"
)
```

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Fully Automatic** - No manual DLL copying required
- ‚úÖ **Efficient** - Only copies DLLs when they change (`copy_if_different`)
- ‚úÖ **Portable** - Executable runs on systems without Qt/MinGW installed
- ‚úÖ **Development Friendly** - Works with any build method (command line, VS Code, etc.)

## Running the Application

After building, the executable and all required DLLs will be in the `build/` directory:

```bash
# Run the application
./build/chopsticks-qt.exe
```

The application will launch the Qt GUI for the Chopsticks game.

## Creating Distribution Packages

üöÄ **This project includes CPack configuration for creating professional distribution packages!**

### Available Package Formats

#### ZIP Package (Ready to Use)
Creates a clean ZIP file with the executable and all dependencies:

```bash
# Build in Release mode
cmake -B build -S . -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release

# Create ZIP package
cd build
cpack -G ZIP
```

This creates: `Chopsticks-Qt-1.0.0-win64.zip` (~10.9 MB)

#### üé® Windows Installer with Custom Icon
For a professional Windows installer with custom chopsticks branding:

1. **Install NSIS** (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System):
   - Download from: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download
   - Or using Chocolatey: `choco install nsis`

2. **Create the installer**:
   ```bash
   cd build
   cpack -G NSIS
