- **Real-time Sync**: Immediate move updates between players
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and error handling

### **Message Types**
```cpp
enum MessageType {
    GameMove,      // Player move (tap/split)
    GameState,     // Complete game state sync
    PlayerJoined,  // New player connection
    PlayerLeft,    // Player disconnection
    GameStart,     // Game start signal
    GameEnd        // Game end signal
};
```

### **Security Features**
- Input validation on all network messages
- Graceful handling of disconnections
- Protection against malformed data

## 📡 Network Setup Examples

### **Local Network (Same Wi-Fi)**
```
Server IP: 192.168.1.100
Port: 12345
Status: ✅ Ready for connections
```

### **Internet Play (Port Forwarding Required)**
```
External IP: 203.0.113.1
Port: 12345
Router: Forward port 12345 to local IP
```

## 🛠️ Building with Network Support

The CMakeLists.txt has been updated to include Qt Network module:

```cmake
find_package(Qt5 COMPONENTS Widgets Network REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(chopsticks-qt Qt5::Widgets Qt5::Network)
```

### **New Source Files**
- `src/aiplayer.h/cpp` - Intelligent computer opponent with 3 difficulty levels
- `src/networkmanager.h/cpp` - Core networking functionality
- `src/networkdialog.h/cpp` - Unified game setup interface

## 🎮 AI Strategy Examples

### **Easy AI Behavior**
```
Turn 1: *thinks* "I'll tap randomly... maybe here?"
Result: Suboptimal but unpredictable moves
Strategy: 30% good moves, 70% random
```

### **Medium AI Behavior**
```
Turn 1: *calculates* "If I tap here, opponent gets 4 fingers..."
Turn 2: *thinks* "But they could split... hmm, 80% chance this is good"
Result: Generally smart with occasional surprises
```

### **Hard AI Behavior**
```
Turn 1: *analyzes* "Optimal move eliminates their left hand"
Turn 2: *plans* "This sets up a winning position in 3 moves"
Result: Ruthlessly efficient gameplay
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### **Quick Local Network Game**
1. Player 1: Host game, note IP address
2. Player 2: Join game using Player 1's IP
3. Both players see connection confirmation
4. Start playing immediately!

### **Internet Game Setup**
1. **Server player**:

- ✅ Test with local IP first (192.168.x.x)

### **Router Configuration**
- Forward TCP port 12345 to server computer
- Check router's port forwarding settings
- Use dynamic DNS for changing IP addresses

### **Network Diagnostics**
